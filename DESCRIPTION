Description: This package prepares data collected in an experimental design for
  statistical analysis (e.g., analysis of variance ;ANOVA) by takeing the
  individual data files and preparing one table that contains several
  possibilities for dependent variables. The package includes a number of
  functions: file_merge(), read_data() and prep(). The file_merge() function
  vertically merges individual data files in a long format in which each line
  is a single trial within the experiment to a single dataset. The read_data()
  function reads a file in a txt or csv format that contains a single dataset
  in a long format table and creates a data frame from it. The prep() function
  aggregates the single dataset according to any combination of between and
  within grouping variables (i.e., between-subjects and within-subjects
  independent variables, respectively), and returns a data frame with a number
  of dependent measures for further analysis for each experimental cell
  according to the combination of provided grouping variables. Dependent
  measures for each experimental cell  include among others means before and
  after rejecting all values above a criterion number of standard deviations,
  number of rejected values according to criterion number of standard
  deviations, proportions of rejected values for each criterion number of
  standard deviations, number of values before rejection,  means after
  rejecting values according to procedures described in Van Selst & Jolicoeur
  (1994) (suitable when measuring reaction-times), standard deviations, medians,
  means according to any percentiles (e.g., 0.05, 0.25, 0.75, 0.95) and harmonic
  means. The data frame prep() returns can also be exported as a txt file to be
  used for statistical analysis in other statistical programs.  This package is
  most suitable when measuring reaction-times and/or accuracy, or any other
  variable in an interval or ratio scale.
