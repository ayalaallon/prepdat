Description: The goal of the package is to take the individual data files and prepare one table for statistical
  analysis (e.g., analysis of variance ;ANOVA) that contains several possibilities for dependent variables. The
  package includes a number of functions: file_merge(), read_data() and prep(). The file_merge() function
  merges individual data files in long format in which each line is a single trial within the experiment to a single
  large dataset. The read_data() function reads a file in a txt or csv format that contains a dataset in a long
  format table and creates a data frame from it. The prep() function aggregates the single dataset
  according to any combination of between and within grouping variables (i.e., between-subjects and within-subjects
  independent variables, respectively) and generates a number of dependent measures for further analysis. Dependent
  measures include among others means before and after rejecting all values above a criterion number of standard
  deviations, means after rejecting values according to procedures described in Van Selst & Jolicoeur (1994) (suitable when measuring reaction-time),
  standard deviations, number of values, number of rejected values, proportions of rejected values for each criterion,
  means according to any percentiles (e.g., 0.05, 0.25, 0.75, 0.95) and harmonic mean. Most suitable when measuring
  reaction-times and/or accuracy, or any other variable in an interval or ratio scale.
