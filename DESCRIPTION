Description: Prepares data collected in an experimental design for statistical
  analysis (e.g., analysis of variance ;ANOVA) by taking the  individual data
  files and preparing one table that contains several possibilities for
  dependent variables. Most suitable when measuring reaction-times and/or
  accuracy, or any other variable in an interval or ratio scale. Functions
  included: file_merge(), read_data() and prep(). The file_merge() function
  vertically merges individual data files (in a long format) in which each line
  is a single trial within the experiment to one single dataset. The
  read_data() function reads a file in a txt or csv format that contains a
  single dataset in a long format table and creates a data frame from it. The
  prep() function aggregates the single dataset according to any combination of
  between and within grouping variables (i.e., between-subjects and
  within-subjects independent variables, respectively), and returns a data
  frame with a number of dependent measures for further analysis for each
  experimental cell according to the combination of provided grouping
  variables. Dependent measures for each experimental cell include among
  others means before and after rejecting all values according to a flexible
  standard deviation criterion/s, number of rejected values according to the
  flexible standard deviation criterion/s, proportions of rejected values
  according to the flexible standard deviation criterion/s, number of values
  before rejection,  means after rejecting values according to procedures
  described in Van Selst & Jolicoeur (1994) (suitable when measuring
  reaction-times), standard deviations, medians, means according to any
  percentile (e.g., 0.05, 0.25, 0.75, 0.95) and harmonic means. The data frame
  prep() returns can also be exported as a txt file to be used for statistical
  analysis in other statistical programs.
